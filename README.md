#K-Means Clustering Project - Unsupervised Learning & Data Segmentation

Overview

This project delves into the K-Means clustering algorithm, a fundamental unsupervised machine learning technique for segmenting datasets based on similarity. The study demonstrates how K-Means efficiently clusters data points by minimizing intra-cluster variance, enabling pattern recognition and data-driven insights.

Key Features

1.Data Preprocessing & Normalization: Handling missing values, feature scaling, and standardization.

2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing distributions, correlations, and optimal cluster count estimation.

3.K-Means Clustering Implementation: Applying clustering techniques for pattern identification.

4.Elbow Method & Silhouette Analysis: Determining the optimal number of clusters.

5.Dimensionality Reduction (PCA & t-SNE): Enhancing visualization and interpretation of high-dimensional data.

6.Performance Evaluation: Interpreting cluster cohesion, separation, and feature relevance.

7.Visualization & Insights: Cluster representation using scatter plots, heatmaps, and 3D projections.
